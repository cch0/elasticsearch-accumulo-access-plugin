# elasticsearch-accumulo-access-plugin

This repository contains the implementation of an Elasticsearch plugin for applying Accumulo's attribute-based-access-control (ABAC) to documents in Elasticsearch.

<br>

## Support for different Elasticsearch and JDK Versions

The CIDCD pipeline for this project can be configured to support multiple different Elasticsearch and JDK versions.
Each combination of Elasticsearch and JDK version will have its own plugin zip file created.

Based on your Elasticsearch version, you are free to choose the one that works best for your environment.

## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by the following works
- [elasticsearch-accumulo-security](https://github.com/jstoneham/elasticsearch-accumulo-security) -
This repository from 2013 provides a possible solution brining Accumulo ABAC into Elasticsearch via custom plugin.
- [Letâ€™s Write a Dang ElasticSearch Plugin](https://www.viget.com/articles/lets-write-a-dang-elasticsearch-plugin/) - This tutorial is an excellent resource for learning how to create an Elasticsearch plugin.
